Some notes when the proxied request is targeting S3 Outpost instead of S3 in region:
- For S3 outpost, the same SIGV4 is also applicable
- The API target is different, which shall follow the scheme below
- In my testing, I find S3 Outpost API is more strict, where "x-amz-content-sha256" is also required to be signed. This header is not required to be signed in S3 region API.

Host name in AWS Region    : Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Host name on AWS Outposts  : MyAccesPointName-AccountID.outpost-ID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com
Host name on AWS Outposts  : Bucketname.outpost-ID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com
Sample Format1             : AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com         OR
Sample Format2             : AccessPointAlias.outpostId.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com

Example Value (Please update to your own)
Format1: https://MyOutpostsAp-123456789012.op-09kx3d28b7b238791.s3-outposts.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Format2: myout-okc142a3187vjeer6xcc3aks1l3be87ke2d121jlu91--op-s3.op-09kxld28g7e238671.s3-outposts.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
